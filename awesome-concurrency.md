* [gramoli/synchrobench](https://github.com/gramoli/synchrobench)  Synchrobench is a micro-benchmark suite used to evaluate synchronization techniques on data structures. Synchrobench is written in C/C++ and Java and currently includes arrays, binary trees, hash tables, linked lists, queues and skip lists that are synchronized with copy-on-write, locks, read-modify-write, read-copy-update and transactional memory. A non-synchronized version of these data structures is proposed in each language as a baseline to measure the performance gain on multi-(/many-)core machines.
* [khizmax/libcds](https://github.com/khizmax/libcds) The Concurrent Data Structures (CDS) library is a collection of concurrent containers that don't require external (manual) synchronization for shared access, and safe memory reclamation (SMR) algorithms like Hazard Pointer and user-space RCU that is used as an epoch-based SMR.
* [Concurrency Kit](http://concurrencykit.org/)  Concurrency primitives, safe memory reclamation mechanisms and non-blocking data structures for the research, design and implementation of high performance concurrent systems.

# Courses

## [Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/)  
Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science is widely recognized as one of the first and best computer science programs in the world. Our programs train the next generation of innovators to solve real-world problems and improve the way people live and work.

### [Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming](http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu) 
From smart phones, to multi-core CPUs and GPUs, to the world's largest supercomputers and web sites, parallel processing is ubiquitous in modern computing. The goal of this course is to provide a deep understanding of the fundamental principles and engineering trade-offs involved in designing modern parallel computing systems as well as to teach parallel programming techniques necessary to effectively utilize these machines. Because writing good parallel programs requires an understanding of key machine performance characteristics, this course will cover both parallel hardware and software design.

### [CPSC 425: Parallel Computing](http://cs.umw.edu/~finlayson/class/fall16/cpsc425/)
This course provides an introduction to parallel computing, covering topics including parallel architectures, programming techniques and libraries, the study of existing parallel computing systems, and performance analysis. Students will use a variety of hardware to explore current libraries and methods used for parallel programming.
