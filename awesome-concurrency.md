* [gramoli/synchrobench](https://github.com/gramoli/synchrobench)  Synchrobench is a micro-benchmark suite used to evaluate synchronization techniques on data structures. Synchrobench is written in C/C++ and Java and currently includes arrays, binary trees, hash tables, linked lists, queues and skip lists that are synchronized with copy-on-write, locks, read-modify-write, read-copy-update and transactional memory. A non-synchronized version of these data structures is proposed in each language as a baseline to measure the performance gain on multi-(/many-)core machines.
* [khizmax/libcds](https://github.com/khizmax/libcds) The Concurrent Data Structures (CDS) library is a collection of concurrent containers that don't require external (manual) synchronization for shared access, and safe memory reclamation (SMR) algorithms like Hazard Pointer and user-space RCU that is used as an epoch-based SMR.
* [Concurrency Kit](http://concurrencykit.org/)  Concurrency primitives, safe memory reclamation mechanisms and non-blocking data structures for the research, design and implementation of high performance concurrent systems.
